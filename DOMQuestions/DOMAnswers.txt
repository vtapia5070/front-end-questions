1. Is there any difference between window and document?
  The document object is a property of the window document, the global object. The window object represents the browser window, the doument object represents the HTML document file being loaded into the browser.

2. Does document.onload and window.onload fire at the same time?
  Document on lload fires when the html document is loaded, not including external content(images, javascript, css). Window.onload fires when the html document and external files are done loading.

3. Is attribute similar to property?
  Each DOM node is linked to an object with properties that can be retrieved and updated through Javascript, and have various types (string, boolean, etc.). Some examples of properties that might be linked to a DOM node are: href, className, ID. Attributes are similar to properties, but are only of the string type. They are declared within the HTML itself and are customizable.

4. What are the different ways to get an element from DOM?
  If the element has an ID: document.getElementById("")
  To get a list of elements with a specific tag name: document.getElementsByTagName() - or a list of elements and children with a specific class name: document.getElementsByClassName();
  If you wanted to get an element by adjacent sibling, parent node, first child, or last child: element.nextSibling() / element.nextSiblingNode(), element.parentNode(), element.firstChild(), element.firstChildNode(), element.lastChild(), element.lastChildNode().

5. Describe event propagation.
  Event propagation describes how events fire off, and in which order, in regards to children or it's parent which all are nested under an event handler. There are two phases: event capturing and event bubbling which can be set by a boolean argument in the eventListener method. Also, different browsers support one or both of the event propagation models.

6. Describe the differences between event bubbling and event capturing.
  Capturing - the parent DOM element should fire the event first when itself or nested child elements are fired. (think "trickling down", netscape's model).
  Event bubbling - the innermost child that fires the event, is fired before the outer most parent element. (think "bubbling up", mozilla)
  Some browsers are support both methods, and when an event is triggered, it is first captured at the outtermost element, then when it reaches the innermost triggered element, it bubbles back up.
  Stop propagtions can be used to stop propagation and you can interupt the propagation to manipulate other elements in the DOM.
